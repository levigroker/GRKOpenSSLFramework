# **NOTE:** This repository has been removed from the public due to circumstances out of my control.

The underlying project [openssl-apple](https://github.com/keeshux/openssl-apple) is excellent and continues to be available, should you need an alternative.

### About

This utilizes [openssl-apple](https://github.com/keeshux/openssl-apple) as a submodule to perform the building of the OpenSSL library for the configured platforms and architectures. Using these built products, this project continues by creating an xcframework suitable for use by Swift.
